#### Exercise 5: Understanding Characterization Tests (1 hour)

Learn the difference between characterization tests and traditional tests:

**Traditional Test (what code SHOULD do):**
```swift
func testCalculateDiscount() {
    let calculator = DiscountCalculator()
    let discount = calculator.calculate(amount: 100, userType: .premium)
    XCTAssertEqual(discount, 20.0) // What we expect it should do
}
```

**Characterization Test (what code ACTUALLY does):**
```swift
func testCalculateDiscountCurrentBehavior() {
    let calculator = DiscountCalculator()
    let discount = calculator.calculate(amount: 100, userType: .premium)
    XCTAssertEqual(discount, 15.3) // What it actually does right now
    // NOTE: This might be a bug, but we're preserving current behavior
}
```

**Practice:**
1. Run `/legacy-safety-net-create` on a specific module
2. Examine the generated characterization tests
3. Understand how they preserve current behavior
4. See how they would catch any changes during refactoring

#### Exercise 6: Testing Your Safety Net (1 hour)

Validate that your safety infrastructure actually works:

```bash
# Test that characterization tests catch changes
/legacy-safety-net-validate --simulate-changes

# Verify rollback procedures work
/legacy-rollback-test --dry-run

# Test mock objects function correctly
/legacy-mock-generator --validate-doubles
```

**Validation Exercises:**
1. **Break Something Intentionally**: Make a small change to see if tests catch it
2. **Test Rollback**: Practice reverting changes quickly
3. **Verify Mocks**: Ensure test doubles behave like real dependencies

Learn the safest transformation technique - adding new functionality:

```bash
# Add new functionality using sprout method
/legacy-sprout-method --target="PaymentProcessor.processPayment" --feature="fraud-detection"
```

**Before: Existing Legacy Code (Unchanged)**
```swift
func processPayment(amount: Double, currency: String) -> PaymentResult {
    // Existing legacy implementation stays exactly the same
    let result = legacyPaymentProcessor.process(amount, currency)
    
    // NEW: Minimal integration with sprouted method
    if result.status == "success" {
        sproutedAddFraudDetection(result: result, amount: amount)
    }
    
    return result
}
```

**After: Sprouted Method (Fully Tested)**
```swift
// NEW: Sprouted method with comprehensive tests
func sproutedAddFraudDetection(result: PaymentResult, amount: Double) {
    // New functionality with 100% test coverage
    if amount > 1000.0 {
        result.flagForReview = true
        analyticsService.track("high_value_payment", amount: amount)
    }
    
    if fraudDetectionService.isHighRisk(amount: amount) {
        result.requiresVerification = true
        notificationService.alertSecurityTeam(result)
    }
}
```

**Practice Exercises:**
1. Add logging to an existing method
2. Add analytics to user interactions
3. Add validation to data input
4. Add error recovery to network calls

#### Exercise 8: Sprout Class Excellence (2 hours)

Create entirely new classes for substantial functionality:

```bash
# Create new class for complex functionality
/legacy-sprout-class --feature="analytics-engine" --integration-point="UserInteractionTracker"
```

**NEW: Sprouted Class (Modern, Fully Tested)**
```swift
// Modern implementation with full test coverage
class AnalyticsEngine {
    private let eventStore: EventStoreProtocol
    private let networkService: NetworkServiceProtocol
    
    init(eventStore: EventStoreProtocol, networkService: NetworkServiceProtocol) {
        self.eventStore = eventStore
        self.networkService = networkService
    }
    
    func trackUserInteraction(_ interaction: UserInteraction) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error> {
        // Modern async/await, dependency injection, comprehensive tests
        return eventStore.store(interaction)
            .flatMap { [weak self] in
                self?.networkService.upload(interaction) ?? Empty().eraseToAnyPublisher()
            }
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
```

**MINIMAL INTEGRATION: One Line Added to Existing Class**
```swift
class UserInteractionTracker {
    func trackInteraction(type: String, data: [String: Any]) {
        // Existing legacy code unchanged
        let result = existingLegacyTracking(type, data)
        
        // NEW: Optional integration with sprouted class
        if let analyticsEngine = self.analyticsEngine {
            let interaction = UserInteraction(type: type, data: data)
            _ = analyticsEngine.trackUserInteraction(interaction)
        }
        
        return result
    }
}
```

#### Exercise 9: Extract Method Techniques (2 hours)

Reduce complexity by extracting well-defined methods:

```bash
# Break down large, complex methods
/legacy-extract-method --target="DataManager.processUserData" --extract="validation,transformation,persistence"
```

**Before: Large, Complex Method**
```swift
func processUserData(userData: [String: Any]) -> ProcessingResult {
    // 150 lines of mixed validation, transformation, and persistence
    // High cyclomatic complexity, hard to test, multiple responsibilities
}
```

**After: Extracted Focused Methods**
```swift
func processUserData(userData: [String: Any]) -> ProcessingResult {
    // Clear, readable flow
    let validationResult = extractedValidateUserData(userData)
    guard validationResult.isValid else {
        return ProcessingResult(error: validationResult.errorMessage)
    }
    
    let transformedData = extractedTransformUserData(userData)
    let persistenceResult = extractedPersistUserData(transformedData)
    
    return ProcessingResult(success: persistenceResult.success)
}

// Each extracted method is focused and fully testable
private func extractedValidateUserData(_ data: [String: Any]) -> ValidationResult {
    // Focused validation logic with comprehensive tests
}

private func extractedTransformUserData(_ data: [String: Any]) -> TransformedData {
    // Focused transformation logic with comprehensive tests
}

private func extractedPersistUserData(_ data: TransformedData) -> PersistenceResult {
    // Focused persistence logic with comprehensive tests
}
```

#### Exercise 10: Wrap Method for Enhancement (2 hours)

Add cross-cutting concerns without changing core logic:

```bash
# Add logging, monitoring, caching without changing existing methods
/legacy-wrap-method --target="APIService.fetchUserData" --enhancement="logging,monitoring,caching"
```

**Transparent Wrapper Implementation**
```swift
// Preserves exact original interface and behavior
class MonitoredAPIServiceWrapper: APIServiceProtocol {
    private let originalService: APIServiceProtocol
    private let logger: LoggerProtocol
    private let monitor: PerformanceMonitor
    private let cache: CacheProtocol
    
    func fetchUserData(userId: String) -> AnyPublisher<UserData, APIError> {
        // ENHANCEMENT: Pre-execution setup
        logger.info("Fetching user data", metadata: ["userId": userId])
        let startTime = Date()
        
        // Check cache first
        if let cachedData = cache.getUserData(userId: userId) {
            logger.info("Cache hit", metadata: ["userId": userId])
            return Just(cachedData).setFailureType(to: APIError.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
        }
        
        // ORIGINAL: Call original method unchanged
        return originalService.fetchUserData(userId: userId)
            .handleEvents(
                receiveOutput: { [weak self] userData in
                    // ENHANCEMENT: Cache and log successful result
                    self?.cache.store(userData, forUserId: userId)
                    let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
                    self?.logger.info("User data fetched successfully", 
                                    metadata: ["userId": userId, "duration": duration])
                    self?.monitor.recordAPICall(duration: duration, success: true)
                },
                receiveCompletion: { [weak self] completion in
                    // ENHANCEMENT: Log and monitor failures
                    if case .failure(let error) = completion {
                        let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
                        self?.logger.error("Failed to fetch user data", 
                                         metadata: ["userId": userId, "error": error.localizedDescription])
                        self?.monitor.recordAPICall(duration: duration, success: false)
                    }
                }
            )
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}

// Factory enables easy feature toggle
func createAPIService() -> APIServiceProtocol {
    let baseService = APIService()
    
    if FeatureFlag.isEnabled(.apiMonitoring) {
        return MonitoredAPIServiceWrapper(originalService: baseService)
    }
    
    return baseService
}

### Common Learning Challenges

**"Assessment results are overwhelming"**
→ Start with highest priority items only. Focus on critical risks first.

**"Not sure which transformation technique to use"**
→ Default to sprout method (safest). Extract method only when complexity is the main issue.

**"Worried about breaking things"**
→ Trust the safety net. If characterization tests pass, behavior is preserved.

**"Team resistance to framework adoption"**
→ Start with individual success stories. Demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

**"Framework seems too complex"**
→ Use only Level 1 commands initially. Build complexity gradually.

### Getting Unstuck

**When Assessment Reveals High Risk:**
1. Don't panic - this is valuable information
2. Focus on safety infrastructure first
3. Consider whether transformation is worth the effort
4. Seek expert guidance for complex situations

**When Transformation Goes Wrong:**
1. Immediately execute rollback procedures
2. Analyze what went wrong
3. Improve safety net to catch similar issues
4. Try again with better preparation

**When Progress Seems Slow:**
1. Remember that safety takes time initially
2. Speed increases as safety infrastructure matures
3. Focus on learning and skill building
4. Celebrate small wins and incremental progress
