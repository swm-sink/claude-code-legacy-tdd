  ## Enhanced Usage Workflow

  ### 1. Initial Assessment
  ```bash
  # Start with safety check
  /legacy-safe-change app/models/user.py
  # Output: ❌ Coverage: 15% (need 70%)
  #         ⚠️  Security issues: 3 found
  #         ⚠️  God object detected: 45 methods
  ```

  ### 2. Build Safety Net
  ```bash
  # First priority: Coverage
  /legacy-characterize app/models/user.py
  # Creates behavior tests

  # Document security state
  /legacy-security-test app/models/user.py
  # Creates security baseline

  # Check antipatterns
  /legacy-antipattern-scan app/models/user.py
  # Documents code smells
  ```

  ### 3. Incremental Improvement
  ```bash
  # After 70% coverage achieved
  /legacy-safe-change app/models/user.py
  # Output: ✅ Safe to modify

  # Add new feature safely
  /legacy-sprout user-two-factor-auth
  # Implements in isolation with full TDD

  # Fix security issues one by one
  /legacy-security-fix sql-injection
  # Updates characterization test after fix
  ```

  ### 4. Refactor When Safe
  ```bash
  # After 85% coverage
  /legacy-antipattern-fix god-object UserModel
  # Splits into smaller classes with tests
  ```

  ## Key Principles Enhanced

  ### Coverage-First Approach
  1. **70% before changes**: Minimum safety net
  2. **85% before refactoring**: Comprehensive coverage
  3. **100% for new code**: All sprouts fully tested

  ### Security by Default
  1. **Document vulnerabilities**: Know what you're dealing with
  2. **Test security behavior**: Ensure fixes don't break functionality
  3. **Incremental hardening**: One vulnerability at a time
  4. **OWASP compliance**: Follow established guidelines

  ### LLM Antipattern Prevention
  1. **God object detection**: Classes limited to 20 methods
  2. **Method size limits**: 50 lines maximum
  3. **Parameter limits**: 5 parameters maximum
  4. **Nesting limits**: 4 levels maximum
  5. **SOLID enforcement**: Single responsibility principle

  ### Safe Modification Process
  ```
  1. Check Safety → 2. Build Tests → 3. Make Changes → 4. Verify → 5. Refactor
  ```

  ## Common Patterns

  ### The Enhanced Legacy Change Algorithm
  1. **Assess current state** (coverage, security, antipatterns)
  2. **Build comprehensive test suite** (70%+ coverage)
  3. **Document security behavior** (even vulnerabilities)
  4. **Make minimal changes** (sprout when possible)
  5. **Fix incrementally** (security, then antipatterns)
  6. **Refactor when safe** (85%+ coverage)

  ### Security-First Sprout
  ```python
  # Secure by default new code
  class SecureUserAuthenticator:  # Sprout class
      def __init__(self):
          self.max_attempts = 3
          self.lockout_duration = 300
          
      def authenticate(self, username, password):
          # Rate limiting built in
          # Password hashing by default
          # Input validation included
          # Full test coverage
          
  # Minimal legacy integration
  class LegacyAuth:
      def login(self, username, password):
          if feature_flags.use_secure_auth:
              return SecureUserAuthenticator().authenticate(username, password)
          # ... legacy code continues ...
  ```

  This enhanced system ensures that legacy code is made safe through comprehensive testing before any modifications, with special
   attention to security vulnerabilities and common LLM-generated antipatterns.\
  \
  I'll research security-first TDD and common LLM coding antipatterns to enhance our approach.I've significantly enhanced both 
  artifacts based on deep research into security-first TDD and common LLM coding issues:

  ## **Enhanced Legacy Code TDD** - Key Improvements:

  ### 1. **Coverage-First Approach**
  - **70% coverage required before ANY changes** (enforced technically)
  - **85% coverage required before refactoring**
  - Coverage enforcer blocks unsafe modifications
  - Suggests specific lines to test for coverage improvement

  ### 2. **Security Characterization**
  Based on Test-Driven Security (TDS) principles where security tests are written first, representing the expected security 
  state:
  - Documents current security behavior (including vulnerabilities)
  - Creates baseline for security improvements
  - Follows OWASP Top 10 guidelines
  - Tests SQL injection, XSS, authentication weaknesses

  ### 3. **LLM Antipattern Detection**
  Addresses common issues:
  - **God Object Detection**: Classes limited to 20 methods
  - **Long Method Prevention**: 50 line maximum
  - **Deep Nesting Prevention**: 4 levels maximum
  - **Responsibility Analysis**: Detects mixed responsibilities
  - Generates refactoring tests to guide improvements

  ### 4. **Safe Change Workflow**
  ```bash
  /legacy-safe-change [file]  # Comprehensive safety check
  /legacy-characterize [file]  # Build test safety net
  /legacy-security-test [file]  # Document security state
  /legacy-antipattern-scan  # Find code smells
  /legacy-sprout [feature]  # Add features safely
  ```

  ## **Enhanced Greenfield TDD** - Key Improvements:

  ### 1. **Security-First TDD Cycle**
  Following Test Driven Security approach where security tests are written before functionality:
  1. 🔒 **Threat Model** - Identify security requirements
  2. 🔴 **Security Red** - Write failing security tests
  3. 🔴 **Feature Red** - Write failing feature tests  
  4. 🟢 **Secure Green** - Implement with security patterns
  5. 🔵 **Safe Refactor** - Improve maintaining security

  ### 2. **Automatic Quality Gates**
  Prevents common LLM issues:
  - **God Objects**: Max 10 public methods per class (automatically blocked)
  - **Method Size**: Max 30 lines (prevents rambling implementations)
  - **Parameters**: Max 4 (prevents complex interfaces)
  - **Nesting**: Max 3 levels (maintains readability)
  - **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10

  ### 3. **Security Patterns Built-In**
  Based on OWASP ASVS and security testing guidelines:
  - Input validation required on all external data
  - Output encoding for XSS prevention
  - Parameterized queries only (no SQL concatenation)
  - Rate limiting by default
  - Security event logging

  ### 4. **LLM-Specific Protections**
  ```python
  # System automatically prevents:
  class UserManager:  # ❌ BLOCKED at 11 methods
      # Too many responsibilities
      
  # Forces better design:
  class UserRepository:  # ✅ Focused
  class UserAuthService:  # ✅ Single responsibility  
  class UserNotifier:  # ✅ Cohesive
  ```

  ## Key Benefits:

  ### For Legacy Code:
  - **Safety First**: Can't modify code without adequate test coverage
  - **Security Awareness**: Vulnerabilities documented before fixing
  - **Gradual Improvement**: Incremental approach to quality
  - **Antipattern Prevention**: God objects detected and prevented

  ### For New Projects:
  - **Security Built In**: Not bolted on later
  - **Quality Enforced**: Automatic prevention of antipatterns
  - **Test Coverage**: 95%+ overall, 100% for security
  - **LLM Safety**: Common AI coding issues prevented

  Both systems now include:
  - Technical enforcement (not relying on Claude's compliance)
  - Security-first mindset from the start
  - Prevention of god objects and other antipatterns
  - Clear workflows with verification at each step

  The enhanced artifacts provide comprehensive, research-backed approaches that address all the concerns: legacy code safety, 
  security-first development, and prevention of common LLM coding issues. \

  ULTRATHINK!!!

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to:

  1. Explore the existing project deeply first
  2. Understand the objective and requirements 
  3. Do deep research on the web to find 20 additional sources for setting up for success with agentic coding using Claude Code
  4. Put test infrastructure in place in a legacy code base before doing any refactoring
  5. They want me to "ULTRATHINK" which suggests they want a very thorough analysis

  Since I'm in plan mode, I need to:
  - First explore the current project structure 
  - Understand what's already there
  - Research extensively about agentic coding with Claude Code and legacy testing approaches
  - Create a comprehensive plan
  - Use the exit_plan_mode tool when ready

  Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand what we're working with.

⏺ I'll explore the existing project, understand the requirements, and conduct deep research on agentic coding with Claude Code
  for legacy test infrastructure. Let me start by examining the current project structure.

⏺ List(.)
  ⎿  Listed 16 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see there are two main directories:
  1. ios_prompt_eng/ - which contains existing Claude Code configuration files adapted for Life360
  2. legacy_code_tdd_prompts/ - which seems to be where we want to build the new framework

  Let me explore both to understand what already exists.

⏺ List(legacy_code_tdd_prompts)
  ⎿  Listed 2 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  It looks like the legacy_code_tdd_prompts directory is empty. Let me examine the ios_prompt_eng directory to understand the 
  existing structure and approach.

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 2810 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/COMMANDS.md)
  ⎿  Read 389 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/README.md)
  ⎿  Read 240 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'm getting a clear picture of what the user has. They have an existing iOS prompt engineering system adapted for Life360, 
  and they want to build out a separate legacy code TDD framework. Let me examine more of the existing structure to understand 
  what they already have.

⏺ Now let me explore the rest of the existing documentation to understand the full scope and then research the latest approaches
  to agentic coding with Claude Code.

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/GETTING_STARTED.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/USER_GUIDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ios_prompt_eng/EXAMPLES.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a good understanding of what they already have. They have:

  1. A comprehensive iOS prompt engineering framework adapted for Life360 with:
    - 50+ refactoring commands 
    - RIB architecture patterns
    - Safety-first approach
    - Progressive learning system
    - Meta-diagnostic system
  2. They want to build a separate legacy code TDD framework for engineers to use, focusing on:
    - Putting test infrastructure in place BEFORE refactoring
    - Following Michael Feathers' principles from "Working Effectively with Legacy Code"
    - Security-first TDD approach
    - LLM antipattern prevention

  Now I need to do deep research on:
  1. Latest approaches to agentic coding with Claude Code
  2. Legacy code TDD best practices 
  3. Security-first testing approaches
  4. LLM coding antipatterns and prevention
  5. Test infrastructure for legacy systems

  Let me start researching these topics extensively.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have comprehensive research on all the key areas needed to design an exceptional legacy code TDD framework. Let 
  me summarize what I've gathered:

  Research Summary:

  1. Agentic Coding with Claude Code (2025)

  - CLAUDE.md as special configuration file that Claude automatically pulls into context
  - "think", "think hard", "think harder", "ultrathink" for progressively more thinking budget
  - Parallel tool execution is crucial for performance
  - Test-driven development becomes even more powerful with agentic coding
  - Subagents for complex problems
  - Markdown checklists for multi-step tasks
  - Custom slash commands in .claude/commands directory

  2. Legacy Code TDD (Michael Feathers)

  - "Legacy code is code without tests"
  - Characterization tests document actual behavior, not desired behavior
  - Test seams as places to alter behavior without editing code directly
  - Dependency breaking techniques: Parameterize Constructor, Extract Interface, Instance Delegator
  - Sprout Method/Class for adding new functionality safely
  - Build safety net BEFORE making changes

  3. Security-First TDD (OWASP 2025)

  - Test Driven Security (TDS): write security tests first, then implement controls
  - OWASP ASVS 5.0 released 2025, AI Testing Guide Phase 2
  - Integration with DevOps CI/CD pipelines
  - Security tests represent expected security state

  4. LLM Coding Antipatterns

  - God objects: >20 methods, multiple responsibilities
  - Common errors: AttributeError (20.9%), TypeError (50%), ValueError (26.9%)
  - LLMs can detect antipatterns with high precision/recall
  - Framework for CI/CD pipeline integration

  5. Modern Testing Infrastructure

  - Characterization/Golden Master testing for legacy systems
  - Mutation testing for test effectiveness measurement
  - Property-based testing for complex validation

  - SAST/DAST integration in DevSecOps pipelines
  - Approval tests for documenting current behavior

  I'll focus on advanced testing infrastructure patterns that enable safe, incremental code transformation. Key strategies 
  include creating flexible dependency injection mechanisms, leveraging test seams to break complex dependencies, and 
  implementing gradual refactoring techniques. Prioritizing fakes over mocks allows more realistic test scenarios while 
  maintaining system isolation. Constructor injection provides clearer dependency management compared to service locator 
  patterns, enabling more transparent and testable code structures.

  Automation becomes critical in this approach. SafeRefactor tools ensure behavior preservation during transformations, while 
  feature flags support controlled, incremental rollouts. Implementing automated test coverage requirements creates a systematic 
  approach to improving legacy system reliability and maintainability.

  The framework will be optimized for agentic coding interactions, enabling seamless collaboration between human developers and 
  AI assistants.

⏺ Based on my comprehensive research, I'm ready to present a complete plan for building an exceptional legacy code TDD framework
  specifically designed for agentic coding with Claude Code. This framework will incorporate the latest 2025 best practices
  across security-first TDD, LLM antipattern prevention, and cutting-edge testing methodologies.

> ULTRATHINK - WE WILL BE STANDING THIS UP USING CLAUDE CODE AGENTIC CODING SO ARTIFICIAL TIMELINES ARE BULLSHIT. ALSO PLAN OUT 
  THE AGENT STREAMS AND CREATE A FOLDER IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY CALLED AGENTS-COMMS WITH A SINGLE JSON TO MANAGE THE ENTIRE PROCESS
   SUCH THAT ALL AGENTS AND YOU HAVE CONTEXT ON THE PLAN!

✻ Thinking…

  The user is absolutely right - I was creating artificial timelines when we're using Claude Code agentic coding, which means we 
  can execute tasks much faster and more efficiently. The user wants me to:

  1. ULTRATHINK this problem
  2. Plan out agent streams for agentic coding execution
  3. Create a comprehensive agent communication system via a JSON file in AGENTS-COMMS folder
  4. Remove artificial timelines since agentic coding doesn't work that way

  I need to think about this as a coordinated multi-agent system where different agents can work in parallel on different aspects
   of the legacy code TDD framework. Each agent would have specific responsibilities and they would coordinate through a central 
  communication system.

  Let me think about the agent streams:

  1. Research Agent: Continuously gathers latest information on TDD, security testing, legacy code patterns
  2. Framework Architect Agent: Designs the overall system architecture and command structure
  3. Command Developer Agent: Creates the individual slash commands for Claude Code
  4. Security Agent: Focuses on security-first TDD, OWASP compliance, vulnerability testing
  5. Testing Infrastructure Agent: Builds characterization tests, mutation testing, property-based testing
  6. Documentation Agent: Creates comprehensive docs, examples, and learning materials
  7. Integration Agent: Handles CI/CD integration, rollback systems, safety mechanisms
  8. Quality Assurance Agent: Tests the framework, validates commands, ensures reliability
  9. Example Builder Agent: Creates real-world transformation examples and case studies
  10. Coordination Agent (me): Orchestrates the overall process and maintains the central communication system

  The JSON communication system should track:
  - Current task assignments for each agent
  - Dependencies between tasks
  - Completion status
  - Blockers and issues
  - Next priorities
  - Knowledge sharing between agents
  - Version control of the framework components

  This is much more realistic for agentic coding - we can have multiple agents working in parallel, coordinating through a 
  central system, and completing tasks as fast as they can execute rather than artificial weekly timelines.

  I'll craft a strategic blueprint that maximizes parallel processing and intelligent coordination. The key is creating a 
  flexible, adaptive system that can dynamically allocate resources and adjust priorities in real-time.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Artificial timelines are nonsense when we're using agentic coding. Let me ULTRATHINK this as a
  coordinated multi-agent system that can execute in parallel at machine speed.

    Phase 3: Integration & Validation (As components complete)

    - Documentation Agent: Document components as they're completed
    - Integration Agent: Wire systems together as they become available
    - Example Builder: Create examples using completed commands
    - QA Agent: Test everything continuously

    Phase 4: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

    - All agents continue operating, improving, and expanding the framework
    - Research Agent provides continuous updates on latest practices
    - Framework evolves based on real-world usage and feedback

    🎯 Key Execution Principles

    1. Parallel by Default

    - Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent components
    - Dependencies tracked automatically in coordination.json
    - No agent waits unnecessarily for others

    2. Communication Through Central Hub

    - All inter-agent communication goes through coordination.json
    - Real-time status updates and dependency tracking
    - Shared knowledge base prevents duplicate work

    3. Continuous Integration

    - Components integrate as soon as they're ready
    - No artificial "phases" - everything flows naturally
    - Quality validation happens continuously

    4. Adaptive Execution

    - Agents can spawn sub-agents for complex tasks
    - Priorities adjust based on discoveries and blockers
    - Framework evolves based on real implementation learnings

    📊 Success Criteria (No Timelines - Completion Driven)

    MVP Ready:

    - Core infrastructure established
    - First 10 commands working
    - Basic security framework operational
    - Test generation system functional

    Production Ready:

    - All 30+ commands implemented and tested
    - Comprehensive security framework
    - Full documentation and examples
    - Integration systems operational

    Excellence Achieved:

    - Real-world validation across multiple legacy codebases
    - Community adoption and feedback integration
    - Continuous improvement systems operational
    - Framework becomes the standard for legacy code TDD

    🎭 Immediate Actions

    1. Create AGENTS-COMMS directory and coordination.json
    2. Initialize all agent streams with their specific contexts
    3. Start Research and Architect agents immediately
    4. Begin parallel execution of all independent streams
    5. Establish continuous coordination and communication patterns

    This approach leverages the true power of agentic coding - coordinated intelligence working at machine speed rather than 
    human pace!

> ALSO THINK ABOUT THE LOGICAL ORDER THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE TO RUN THESE COMMANDS

✻ Thinking…

  The user has approved the plan and now wants me to start coding. They also want me to think about the logical order that people
   will run these commands - this is crucial for the user experience.

  Let me think about the logical command execution order for someone working with legacy code:

  1. Assessment First - You need to understand what you're dealing with
    - /legacy-assess-risk - What are the biggest risks?
    - /legacy-dependency-analysis - How is this code structured?
    - /legacy-coverage-report - How much test coverage exists?
  2. Safety Net Creation - Before touching anything, create safety
    - /legacy-characterize-behavior - Document current behavior
    - /legacy-security-baseline - Document current security state  
    - /legacy-safety-net-create - Build comprehensive test coverage
  3. Dependency Breaking - Make code testable
    - /legacy-seam-identify - Find places to break dependencies
    - /legacy-mock-generator - Create test doubles
    - /legacy-dependency-inject - Gradually add DI
  4. Safe Transformation - Now you can safely change things
    - /legacy-sprout-method or /legacy-sprout-class - Add new features safely
    - /legacy-god-object-split - Break up large classes
    - /legacy-antipattern-fix - Fix detected issues
  5. Continuous Validation - Ensure you haven't broken anything
    - /legacy-mutation-test - Validate test quality
    - /legacy-rollback-prepare - Set up safety nets
    - QA and integration testing

  This needs to be built into the framework as a guided workflow, not just random commands.

  Let me start by creating the coordination system and then build out the logical command flow.

⏺ Perfect! The logical command execution order is crucial for user success. Let me start building this framework with a clear
  workflow that guides users through the safe transformation process.
