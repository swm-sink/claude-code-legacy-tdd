# Legacy Rollback Testing - Validation of Emergency Recovery Procedures

**Command**: `/legacy-rollback-test`  
**Phase**: Safety Infrastructure Creation  
**Coverage Requirement**: Rollback preparation complete (blocks without this)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (tests rollback procedures in isolated environment)

## Objective

Test and validate all rollback procedures in a safe, isolated environment to ensure emergency recovery mechanisms work correctly before beginning any legacy code transformation, providing confidence in the safety net.

## Context

This command validates that rollback procedures established by `/legacy-rollback-prepare` actually work as expected. It creates test scenarios, executes rollback procedures in controlled conditions, and verifies system recovery capabilities.

## Rollback Testing Tasks

1. **Prerequisite Validation**:
   - Verify that rollback preparation has been completed from `/legacy-rollback-prepare`
   - Confirm that all safety infrastructure is in place (characterization tests, mocks, coverage)

5. **Recovery Validation Testing**:
   - **System Integrity Verification**: Ensure rolled-back system maintains full integrity and functionality
   - **Test Suite Execution**: Run complete test suite after rollback to verify system health
   - **Performance Validation**: Confirm rolled-back system meets performance baselines
   - **Security Posture Verification**: Validate security configuration and posture after rollback

6. **Framework-Specific Rollback Testing**:
   - **iOS/Swift Projects**: Test Xcode project rollback, dependency management rollback, and iOS-specific deployment rollback
   - **Node.js/JavaScript Projects**: Validate npm package rollback, build artifact restoration, and JavaScript deployment rollback
   - **Python Projects**: Test pip/conda environment rollback, virtual environment restoration, and Python service rollback
   - **Java Projects**: Validate Maven/Gradle dependency rollback, JAR/WAR artifact restoration, and Java application rollback
   - **Generic Projects**: Test manual rollback procedures and verification checklists for non-standard environments

## Rollback Test Scenarios

2. **Communication Protocols**: Validate notification and communication procedures during rollback events
3. **Manual Verification Steps**: Test manual verification procedures to confirm rollback success
4. **Documentation Accuracy**: Verify rollback documentation is accurate and complete

### Recovery Time Testing
1. **Baseline Recovery Time**: Establish baseline recovery times for different rollback scenarios
2. **Performance Impact**: Measure impact of rollback procedures on system performance during recovery
3. **Resource Requirements**: Document resource requirements (CPU, memory, disk) during rollback execution
4. **Scaling Considerations**: Test rollback procedures under different system load conditions

## Rollback Validation Procedures

### System Health Verification
1. **Functional Testing**: Execute comprehensive functional tests after rollback to verify system operation
2. **Integration Testing**: Run integration tests to ensure external system connections work correctly
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance matches pre-transformation baseline
4. **Security Testing**: Confirm security configuration and access controls work correctly after rollback

### Test Suite Validation

2. **Unit Test Suite**: Execute complete unit test suite to ensure code functionality
3. **Integration Test Suite**: Run integration tests to validate system component interactions
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Execute user workflow tests to confirm complete system functionality

### Data Integrity Verification
1. **Database Consistency**: Verify database schema and data consistency after rollback
2. **File System Integrity**: Check file system state and configuration file consistency
3. **Configuration Validation**: Ensure all configuration settings are correctly restored
4. **Dependency State**: Validate all external dependencies are in correct state after rollback

## Rollback Test Documentation and Reporting

### Test Results Documentation
1. **Execution Reports**: Document detailed results of each rollback test scenario
2. **Time Measurements**: Record execution times for all rollback procedures and validation steps
3. **Failure Analysis**: Document any failures or issues encountered during rollback testing
4. **Improvement Recommendations**: Identify areas for rollback procedure improvement based on test results

### Rollback Procedure Validation
1. **Procedure Accuracy**: Validate accuracy and completeness of documented rollback procedures
2. **Script Validation**: Confirm all rollback scripts execute correctly in test environment
3. **Decision Criteria**: Verify rollback trigger criteria are appropriate and actionable
4. **Communication Plans**: Test notification and communication procedures for rollback events

### Emergency Response Readiness
1. **Response Time Assessment**: Evaluate ability to execute rollback within required timeframes
2. **Resource Availability**: Confirm necessary resources and personnel are available for emergency rollback
3. **Escalation Procedures**: Test escalation procedures for complex rollback scenarios
4. **Post-Rollback Analysis**: Establish procedures for analyzing rollback causes and improving processes

## Success Criteria
- All rollback scenarios tested successfully in isolated environment
- Rollback procedures execute within acceptable time limits for emergency response
- System integrity and functionality verified after rollback completion
- All characterization tests pass after rollback to confirm behavior preservation
- Rollback procedures documented, validated, and ready for emergency use
- Complete confidence established in safety net and emergency recovery capabilities

## Integration
- Documents rollback testing completion status and validation results
- Validates safety infrastructure is ready for transformation activities
- Provides verified emergency recovery capability for all subsequent legacy code modifications
- Establishes operational confidence in transformation safety procedures

## Rollback
Rollback testing is validation activity that requires no rollback procedures itself. If rollback testing reveals issues:
1. Update rollback procedures to address identified gaps or failures
2. Re-test improved rollback procedures until all scenarios pass successfully
3. Update documentation to reflect any changes or improvements to rollback processes
4. Ensure all stakeholders are informed of validated rollback capabilities and procedures
