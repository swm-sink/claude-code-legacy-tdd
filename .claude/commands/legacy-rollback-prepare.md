# Legacy Rollback Preparation - Comprehensive Safety Net Establishment

**Command**: `/legacy-rollback-prepare`  
**Phase**: Safety Infrastructure Creation  
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ coverage + mocks + seams (blocks without this)  
**Risk Level**: Low (safety infrastructure only, no production changes)

## Objective

Establish comprehensive rollback procedures and safety mechanisms to enable immediate restoration of the previous working state if any transformation introduces regressions, ensuring zero-downtime recovery capability.

## Context

Rollback preparation is the final safety net before transformation. This command creates automated rollback procedures, configuration snapshots, database migration rollbacks, and validation scripts to guarantee that any change can be immediately and safely reversed.

## Rollback Preparation Tasks

1. **Prerequisite Validation**:
   - Verify that 90%+ test coverage requirement has been met from `/legacy-coverage-report`
   - Confirm that mock generation has been completed from `/legacy-mock-generator`
   - Validate that seam analysis and characterization tests are in place
   - Check that all safety infrastructure components are ready for transformation

2. **Current State Snapshot Creation**:
   - **Source Code Snapshot**: Create comprehensive backup of current source code state
   - **Configuration Backup**: Capture all configuration files, environment variables, and settings
   - **Database Schema Backup**: Document current database structure and create restoration scripts
   - **Dependency State Capture**: Record current dependency versions and lock files

3. **Rollback Infrastructure Setup**:
   - **Rollback Directory Structure**: Create organized directory structure for rollback assets and procedures
   - **Version Control Integration**: Establish git-based rollback procedures with tagged releases
   - **Automated Rollback Scripts**: Generate automated rollback scripts for different failure scenarios
   - **Rollback Validation Tools**: Create tools to validate rollback success and system integrity

4. **Rollback Scenario Planning**:
   - **Test Failure Rollback**: Procedures for rolling back when characterization tests fail
   - **Performance Regression Rollback**: Scripts for reverting changes that impact system performance
   - **Security Regression Rollback**: Emergency procedures for rolling back security-related issues
   - **Integration Failure Rollback**: Recovery procedures for external integration failures

5. **Rollback Testing and Validation**:
   - **Rollback Test Execution**: Test rollback procedures in safe environment to ensure they work
   - **Rollback Validation Scripts**: Create scripts to verify rollback completeness and system state
   - **Recovery Time Measurement**: Measure and document expected rollback and recovery times
   - **Rollback Documentation**: Complete documentation of rollback procedures and decision trees

6. **Framework-Specific Rollback Preparation**:
   - **iOS/Swift Projects**: Configure Xcode project rollback, dependency manager state, and iOS-specific deployment rollback
   - **Node.js/JavaScript Projects**: Set up npm/yarn package rollback, build artifact restoration, and JavaScript deployment rollback
   - **Python Projects**: Prepare pip/conda environment rollback, virtual environment restoration, and Python service rollback
   - **Java Projects**: Configure Maven/Gradle dependency rollback, JAR/WAR artifact restoration, and Java application rollback
   - **Generic Projects**: Establish manual rollback procedures and verification checklists for non-standard environments

## Rollback Scenario Classification

### Critical Rollback Triggers (Immediate Action Required)
- **Characterization Test Failures**: When existing behavior preservation tests start failing
- **Security Regression Detection**: When security scans detect new vulnerabilities or reduced security posture
- **Performance Degradation**: When system performance drops below acceptable thresholds
- **Production Error Increase**: When error rates or failure counts exceed baseline metrics

### Warning Level Triggers (Planned Rollback)
- **Code Quality Degradation**: When static analysis shows significant quality metric decline
- **Test Coverage Reduction**: When test coverage drops below the required 90% threshold
- **Dependency Conflicts**: When new dependency versions cause compatibility issues
- **Integration Test Failures**: When integration tests with external systems fail

### Rollback Infrastructure Components

### Version Control Rollback Management
1. **Git Tag Strategy**: Create rollback points with semantic versioning and detailed metadata
2. **Branch Protection**: Establish protected branches and rollback branch naming conventions
3. **Commit Verification**: Ensure all rollback commits are signed and verified for integrity
4. **Merge Strategy**: Define fast-forward vs. merge commit strategies for rollback scenarios

### Database Rollback Procedures
- **Schema Migrations**: Reversible database schema changes with automated rollback scripts
- **Data Migrations**: Data transformation rollback procedures with backup and restore capabilities
- **Connection Configuration**: Database connection rollback and failover procedures
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic transaction handling for database rollback scenarios

### Configuration and Environment Rollback
- **Environment Variables**: Rollback procedures for environment configuration changes
- **Configuration Files**: Automated restoration of configuration files and settings
- **Feature Flags**: Rollback procedures for feature flag changes and A/B testing
- **External Service Configuration**: API keys, endpoints, and third-party service configuration rollback

### Deployment and Infrastructure Rollback
- **Application Deployment**: Rolling deployment rollback and canary deployment reversal
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Server configuration and infrastructure setup rollback
- **Monitoring Configuration**: Alert configuration and monitoring setup rollback
- **Load Balancer Configuration**: Traffic routing and load balancing rollback procedures

## Rollback Validation and Testing

### Rollback Testing Procedures
1. **Rollback Dry Run**: Test rollback procedures in isolated environment without affecting production
2. **Rollback Time Measurement**: Measure and document rollback execution time for different scenarios
3. **Rollback Completeness Verification**: Ensure all components are properly restored to previous state
4. **Post-Rollback Validation**: Comprehensive testing after rollback to ensure system integrity

### Rollback Success Criteria
- **System Functionality**: All critical system functions operate as expected after rollback
- **Performance Baseline**: System performance matches or exceeds pre-change baseline
- **Security Posture**: Security configuration and posture maintained after rollback
- **Data Integrity**: No data loss or corruption during rollback process

### Rollback Documentation and Communication
- **Rollback Procedures**: Step-by-step rollback procedures for different failure scenarios
- **Decision Trees**: Clear decision criteria for when to execute rollback procedures
- **Communication Plans**: Stakeholder notification and communication during rollback events
- **Post-Rollback Analysis**: Process for analyzing rollback causes and preventing future occurrences

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Scenarios
1. **Security Breach Detection**: Immediate rollback procedures for security incident response
2. **System Outage**: Emergency rollback procedures for system availability restoration
3. **Data Corruption**: Data integrity protection and restoration procedures
4. **Critical Bug Introduction**: Fast rollback for critical functionality failures

### Rollback Execution Protocol
- **Rollback Authorization**: Clear authorization chain and approval process for rollback execution
- **Rollback Notification**: Automated notification system for rollback initiation and completion
- **Rollback Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring during rollback execution to detect issues
- **Rollback Validation**: Immediate validation procedures after rollback completion

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive rollback procedures established for all transformation scenarios
- Automated rollback scripts created and tested for different failure conditions
- Complete current state snapshot captured with restoration verification
- Rollback testing completed with documented recovery times and success criteria
- Emergency rollback procedures documented with clear decision criteria and execution steps

## Integration
- Updates `AGENTS-COMMS/coordination.json` with rollback preparation completion status
- Provides safety net procedures for all subsequent transformation commands
- Establishes foundation for risk-free transformation with immediate recovery capability
- Enables confident transformation execution with comprehensive fallback procedures

## Rollback
Rollback preparation is safety infrastructure creation and requires no rollback procedures itself. The output of this command IS the rollback infrastructure for all subsequent transformation activities.
