# Legacy Interface Extraction - Dependency Abstraction for Testability

**Command**: `/legacy-extract-interface`  
**Phase**: Transformation  
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ coverage + seam analysis complete (blocks without this)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (creates abstractions for existing dependencies)

## Objective

Extract interfaces/protocols from concrete dependencies to enable dependency injection, improve testability, and create clean architectural boundaries while maintaining all existing functionality through comprehensive safety measures.

## Context

Interface extraction is essential for making legacy code testable by breaking hard dependencies on concrete classes. This command identifies tight coupling opportunities, creates appropriate abstractions, and enables dependency injection without modifying existing behavior.

## Interface Extraction Analysis Tasks

1. **Prerequisite Validation**:
   - Verify that 90%+ test coverage requirement has been met and seam analysis is complete
   - Confirm that dependency analysis has identified concrete dependencies for abstraction
   - Validate that mock infrastructure is ready to support new interface implementations
   - Check that characterization tests are in place for components using target dependencies

2. **Concrete Dependency Identification**:
   - **Hard Dependencies**: Find direct instantiation of external services, APIs, databases, file systems
   - **Framework Dependencies**: Identify tight coupling to framework-specific implementations
   - **Third-Party Libraries**: Locate direct usage of external libraries that complicate testing
   - **System Resources**: Find dependencies on system calls, time, random number generation, network resources

3. **Interface Design Analysis**:
   - **Contract Definition**: Analyze how concrete dependencies are actually used to define minimal interfaces
   - **Method Signature Analysis**: Identify the specific methods and parameters needed from dependencies
   - **Behavioral Requirements**: Document expected behavior, error handling, and edge cases for abstractions
   - **Future Extension Planning**: Design interfaces that can accommodate future requirements and implementations

4. **Abstraction Strategy Planning**:
   - **Interface Granularity**: Determine appropriate level of abstraction (fine-grained vs. coarse-grained interfaces)
   - **Naming Strategy**: Develop clear, intention-revealing names for interfaces and methods
   - **Segregation Planning**: Apply Interface Segregation Principle to avoid fat interfaces
   - **Technology-Specific Patterns**: Use framework-appropriate abstraction patterns (protocols, interfaces, traits)

## Interface Extraction Implementation Tasks

### Interface Design and Creation

1. **Minimal Interface Definition**:
   - Create interfaces that expose only the methods actually used by consuming code
   - Define clear method signatures with appropriate parameter types and return values
   - Include comprehensive documentation of expected behavior and contracts
   - Specify error handling requirements and exception specifications

2. **Concrete Implementation Adaptation**:
   - Modify existing concrete classes to implement the newly extracted interfaces
   - Ensure that existing behavior is preserved exactly during interface implementation
   - Add any necessary adapter logic to bridge interface contracts with existing implementations
   - Validate that concrete implementations fulfill all interface contracts correctly

3. **Consumer Code Modification**:
   - Update code that uses concrete dependencies to depend on interfaces instead
   - Implement dependency injection at identified seam points
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition to interface-based dependencies
   - Ensure that all existing functionality continues to work with interface-based dependencies

### Framework-Specific Interface Extraction

#### iOS/Swift Interface Extraction
- Create Swift protocols with appropriate associated types and requirements
- Use protocol extensions to provide default implementations where appropriate
- Implement protocol composition for complex dependency requirements
- Handle Swift optionals and error throwing properly in protocol definitions

#### JavaScript/Node.js Interface Extraction
- Define interface contracts using TypeScript interfaces or JSDoc annotations
- Use dependency injection patterns appropriate for JavaScript modules
- Implement factory patterns or service locator patterns for dependency management
- Handle asynchronous operations (Promises, async/await) properly in interface definitions

#### Python Interface Extraction
- Create abstract base classes using ABC module or Protocol classes for typing
- Use duck typing appropriately while maintaining clear interface contracts
- Implement dependency injection using constructor injection or property injection
- Handle Python-specific features (decorators, context managers) in interface definitions

#### Java Interface Extraction
- Create Java interfaces with appropriate generic types and exception specifications
- Use dependency injection frameworks (Spring, Guice) for interface-based injection
- Implement appropriate design patterns (Factory, Strategy) for interface usage
- Handle checked exceptions and lifecycle management in interface definitions

## Interface Implementation and Integration

### Dependency Injection Implementation

1. **Constructor Injection Setup**:
   - Modify consuming classes to accept interface dependencies through constructors
   - Implement dependency injection container or factory pattern for interface provision
   - Ensure that all dependencies are properly injected and available when needed
   - Validate that constructor injection doesn't break existing instantiation patterns

2. **Mock Implementation Creation**:
   - Create comprehensive mock implementations for all extracted interfaces
   - Implement test doubles that accurately represent interface contracts
   - Provide configurable behavior for different testing scenarios and edge cases
   - Integrate mock implementations with existing test infrastructure

3. **Production Configuration**:
   - Set up dependency injection configuration for production environments
   - Ensure that concrete implementations are properly wired to interface dependencies
   - Validate that production configuration maintains all existing functionality
   - Test configuration changes in staging environment before production deployment

### Interface Validation and Testing

1. **Contract Validation Testing**:
   - Create tests that validate interface contracts are properly implemented by concrete classes
   - Test all interface methods with various inputs to ensure consistent behavior
   - Validate error handling and exception throwing according to interface specifications
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions through interface contracts

2. **Integration Testing with Mocks**:
   - Test consuming code with mock implementations to validate interface usage
   - Ensure that mock behavior accurately represents real dependency behavior
   - Test error scenarios and failure conditions using controllable mock implementations
   - Validate that tests using mocks provide meaningful feedback about code behavior

3. **Behavioral Preservation Validation**:
   - Run comprehensive characterization tests to ensure no behavioral changes
   - Test all existing functionality with new interface-based dependencies
   - Validate that performance characteristics are maintained with interface abstraction
   - Ensure that all edge cases and error conditions continue to work correctly

## Interface Quality and Design Validation

### Interface Design Quality Assessment

1. **Single Responsibility Validation**: Ensure each interface has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Interface Segregation Compliance**: Verify that interfaces are not too large or have unrelated methods
3. **Dependency Inversion Achievement**: Confirm that high-level modules no longer depend on low-level details
4. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Ensure all implementations can be substituted without affecting correctness

### Long-term Maintainability

1. **Interface Evolution Strategy**: Plan for how interfaces can evolve without breaking existing code
2. **Implementation Flexibility**: Ensure interfaces provide enough flexibility for future implementations
3. **Documentation Quality**: Provide comprehensive documentation for interface contracts and usage
4. **Testing Strategy**: Establish patterns for testing interface implementations and consumers

## Rollback and Recovery Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Any characterization test failures after interface extraction
- Compilation errors or runtime exceptions introduced by interface changes
- Performance degradation or memory leaks introduced by interface abstraction
- Integration failures with existing systems or dependencies

### Rollback Execution
1. **Git-Based Rollback**: Immediate restoration to pre-extraction state using version control
2. **Interface Removal**: Systematic removal of interface abstractions and restoration of direct dependencies
3. **Dependency Restoration**: Re-establishment of original concrete dependency relationships
4. **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing to ensure successful rollback and system integrity

## Success Criteria

- Concrete dependencies successfully abstracted behind well-designed interfaces
- Dependency injection implemented with comprehensive mock infrastructure
- All existing behavior preserved with 100% characterization test validation
- Improved testability through controllable interface-based dependencies
- Clean architectural boundaries established through appropriate abstraction levels
- Complete rollback capability maintained throughout interface extraction process

## Integration

- Documents interface extraction completion status and architectural improvements
- Provides foundation for comprehensive testing through mockable dependencies
- Enables further refactoring by reducing coupling to concrete implementations
- Establishes clean architecture patterns for future development

## Rollback

Interface extraction can be completely reversed if issues arise:
1. **Dependency Restoration**: Remove interfaces and restore direct concrete dependencies
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove dependency injection infrastructure and interface implementations
3. **Test Validation**: Verify system works correctly with original concrete dependencies
4. **Issue Documentation**: Record extraction failure reasons for future improvement attempts
