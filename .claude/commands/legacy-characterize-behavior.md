# Legacy Characterization Testing - Behavior Documentation and Preservation

**Command**: `/legacy-characterize-behavior`  
**Phase**: Safety Infrastructure Creation  
**Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ coverage established (blocks without this)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (creates comprehensive test suite)

## Objective

Create comprehensive characterization tests that document and preserve the ACTUAL current behavior of legacy code (including bugs and quirks), enabling safe refactoring by ensuring any behavioral changes are immediately detected.

## Context

Characterization tests are the foundation of safe legacy transformation. Unlike traditional tests that verify intended behavior, these tests capture and preserve actual current behavior, allowing refactoring with confidence that functionality won't change unexpectedly.

## Characterization Testing Tasks

1. **Prerequisite Validation**:
   - Verify that 90%+ test coverage requirement has been met from `/legacy-coverage-report`
   - Confirm that risk assessment and dependency analysis have been completed
   - Validate that the codebase is ready for characterization testing
   - Check that necessary testing infrastructure and tools are available

2. **Legacy Behavior Analysis**:
   - **Actual Behavior Documentation**: Identify and document the current behavior of legacy components, including bugs, quirks, and edge cases
   - **Critical Path Identification**: Map the most important user journeys and business logic flows
   - **Edge Case Discovery**: Find boundary conditions, error scenarios, and unusual input handling
   - **Integration Point Analysis**: Document how legacy components interact with external systems and dependencies

3. **Golden Master Test Creation**:
   - **Output Capture**: Create comprehensive golden master tests that capture current system outputs
   - **Approval Testing**: Set up human-reviewable output comparisons for complex results
   - **Behavioral Snapshots**: Document current behavior patterns with executable tests
   - **Integration Behavior**: Capture how legacy components interact with each other and external systems

4. **Characterization Test Implementation**:
   - **Test Suite Creation**: Build comprehensive test suite that documents actual current behavior
   - **Input/Output Documentation**: Create tests that capture current input processing and output generation
   - **Error Behavior Capture**: Document how the system currently handles errors and edge cases
   - **Performance Characterization**: Capture current performance characteristics and resource usage

5. **Test Infrastructure Setup**:
   - **Test Execution Framework**: Set up testing framework appropriate for the detected technology stack
   - **Mock Integration**: Integrate with mock system from `/legacy-mock-generator` for external dependencies
   - **Test Data Management**: Create test data sets that exercise all identified behavior patterns
   - **Continuous Execution**: Set up characterization tests to run continuously during transformation

6. **Framework-Specific Implementation**:
   - **iOS/Swift Projects**: Set up XCTest-based characterization tests with golden master pattern using Swift testing infrastructure
   - **Node.js/JavaScript Projects**: Configure Jest-based approval testing with human-reviewable output comparison
   - **Python Projects**: Implement pytest-based characterization tests with fixture management and output verification
   - **Java Projects**: Create JUnit-based golden master tests with comprehensive behavioral documentation
   - **Generic Projects**: Establish manual characterization procedures with documented behavioral patterns

## Component Selection and Prioritization

Identify and prioritize components for characterization testing based on:

### High Priority Components (Business Critical)
- **Payment Processing**: Any components handling financial transactions, payment validation, or money calculations
- **Authentication/Authorization**: User login, session management, access control, and security validation logic
- **Data Processing**: Core business logic that transforms, validates, or processes critical business data
- **Integration Points**: Components that interface with external systems, APIs, or third-party services

### Medium Priority Components (Complex or Risk-Prone)  
- **State Management**: Objects with complex state transitions, workflow engines, or status management
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Custom sorting, calculation, parsing, or transformation algorithms
- **Error Handling**: Components with complex error handling, recovery, or fallback mechanisms
- **Configuration Processing**: Settings management, environment handling, or configuration validation

### Component Analysis Tasks
1. **Load Risk Assessment Data**: Use results from `/legacy-assess-risk` to identify high-risk components
2. **Business Criticality Assessment**: Prioritize components based on business impact and user-facing functionality
3. **Complexity Metrics Analysis**: Identify components with high cyclomatic complexity or large method counts
4. **Integration Dependency Mapping**: Focus on components with external dependencies or integration points

## Golden Master Test Generation

Create comprehensive golden master tests that capture current behavior:

### Output Capture Strategies
- **Complex Object Serialization**: Capture structured data outputs in human-readable formats (JSON, XML, formatted text)
- **Approval Testing**: Set up human-reviewable output comparisons for complex business logic results
- **Behavioral Snapshots**: Document current behavior patterns including error conditions and edge cases
- **Performance Characterization**: Capture timing and resource usage patterns for critical operations

### Test Infrastructure Creation
1. **Golden Master Helpers**: Create framework-appropriate helper classes for output verification and comparison
2. **Approval Test Infrastructure**: Set up approval testing workflows with review and approval processes
3. **Test Data Management**: Create representative test data sets that exercise various behavior patterns
4. **Deterministic Output Handling**: Normalize timestamps, IDs, and other volatile data for consistent testing

## Behavior Pattern Documentation

Implement comprehensive behavior characterization tests:

### Input/Output Behavior Analysis
- **String Processing**: Document text transformation, validation, and formatting behaviors
- **Data Validation**: Capture validation rules, error messages, and edge case handling
- **Calculation Logic**: Characterize mathematical operations, business rule applications, and formula implementations
- **State Transitions**: Document state machine behaviors, workflow transitions, and status changes

### Error Handling Characterization
- **Exception Patterns**: Document what errors are thrown for various invalid inputs
- **Error Recovery**: Capture fallback behaviors and error recovery mechanisms
- **Validation Messages**: Document user-facing error messages and validation feedback
- **Edge Case Behavior**: Characterize boundary conditions and unusual input handling

### Integration Behavior Testing
- **Network Service Behavior**: Mock external dependencies and characterize parsing and response handling
- **Database Integration**: Document data access patterns and query result processing
- **File System Operations**: Characterize file handling, path processing, and I/O behaviors
- **Configuration Processing**: Document configuration loading, validation, and application

## Test Execution and Validation

Execute characterization tests and validate results:

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Framework-Specific Execution**: Run tests using appropriate testing framework for the detected technology
2. **Golden Master Generation**: Create initial golden master files by capturing current behavior
3. **Output Validation**: Verify that captured outputs are reasonable and don't contain sensitive data
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of error conditions and boundary cases

### Quality Validation
- **Output Sanity Checks**: Review golden masters for obvious errors, corruption, or invalid data
- **Sensitive Data Removal**: Strip passwords, tokens, timestamps, and other volatile information
- **Deterministic Testing**: Ensure tests produce consistent results across multiple runs
- **Representative Data**: Validate that test inputs reflect realistic production scenarios

## Documentation and Review Process

Create comprehensive documentation for characterization tests:

### Review Requirements
1. **Golden Master Review**: Manual review of all captured behavior patterns to ensure correctness
2. **Behavior Documentation**: Document known bugs, quirks, and intentional behaviors that should be preserved
3. **Test Coverage Assessment**: Verify that critical business logic and integration points are characterized
4. **Sensitive Data Audit**: Ensure no confidential information is captured in test outputs

### Integration Documentation
- **Safety Net Integration**: Document how characterization tests integrate with overall framework safety net
- **Transformation Readiness**: Establish criteria for proceeding with code transformation activities
- **Maintenance Procedures**: Document how to update golden masters when behavior changes are intentional
- **Review Checklist**: Provide clear guidelines for approving characterization test outputs

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive characterization tests created for all business-critical components
- Golden master tests capture complex outputs for effective regression detection
- Approval tests enable human review of important behavior changes
- All tests are executable and integrated with existing testing infrastructure
